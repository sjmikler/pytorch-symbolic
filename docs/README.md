Package pytorch-functional adds functional API for model creation to PyTorch.

Defining complex models in PyTorch requires creating classes.
[Defining models in tensorflow is easier](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/functional).
This makes it just as easy in PyTorch.

* Small extension to PyTorch
* No dependencies besides PyTorch
* Produces models entirely compatible with PyTorch
* Reduces the amount of code that you need to write

## Installation

Install easily with pip:

```
pip install pytorch-functional
```
